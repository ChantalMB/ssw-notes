The narration of a later PC supplication by the ministers of Dysart explains why.  They requested that her trial should not be moved to Edinburgh due to the poverty of the Burgh of Dysart.  The Lord Chief Justice agreed.  They specified that since her first trial (ending in acquittal and release) many confessed witches had denounced her.  The bailies and ministers requested and received a new order for arrest.  The bailie David Chrystie refused to arrest her because the warrant did not specify the breaking down of doors.  The ministers sought a new commission for breaking down doors.  They appointed Alexander Colville, justice depute, as prosecutor.  She resisted arrest for a while, turned herself in so the case could proceed, but no charges were filed against her with Colville, so she requested and got an order for release from prison in Dysart.","A central justiciary trial was ordered on 16/3/1630, then the Lord Chief Justice appointed deputies to run the trial in the locality.  Three local men were appointed then removed after the suspect complained to the PC.  The local bailies and ministers were then re-appointed after they appealed to the PC.  The trial was relocated back to Dysart with central representatives.",NULL
