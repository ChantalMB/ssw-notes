"The commission does not give any information about accusations.  Her confessions in Pitcairn are too detailed to be able to put all the information in this case.  Anyone interested in her case should consult the printed documents!  This case could be the source for many of our modern ideas about witches (covens of 13, riding broomsticks, shape-changing, and lurid witches' meetings).  But is should be remembered that this case is not typical of most Scottish witchcraft cases.","She met the Devil in the Kirk of Auldearn. He was at the reader's desk with a black book in his hand.  He baptised her with blood he sucked out of her Devil's mark, spouted it in her hand and sprinkled it over her head.  His nature was cold.  She said that each witch had a spirit to wait on them.  One woman's was named 'swein' and was clothed in grass-green.  The text has detailed descriptions of people's spirits.  Her spirit was called 'The read reiver' and was dressed in black.  The Devil baptised her as 'Janet'.  The Devil's member was great and long.  She said that younger women had greater pleasure in sex with the Devil than with their own husbands.  The Devil beat them at meetings.  The Devil gave them money that turned into horse dung.","At Nairn she claimed that she and two others raised an unchristened child and used it to make a potion (see folk culture section for details).  She talked about covens and claimed to have 13 people in her coven.  Her coven danced on a hill with another coven.  At one meeting she yoked a plough of paddocks (toads).  They used this to take the fruit of the land.  The officer of her coven was man.  They often stole food from people.  She described taking grain and animals and leaving empty husks (later developed in fairylore).  Described flying on straw (corn straw, wild straw).  They did a ritual with a thread with three knots in a dye-house, they took away the dye and turned it all black.  She said that each coven of 13 had an officer (who is male) and a maiden (who is female).  The Devil took the maiden over the dyk.","She confessed to mixing the body of an unchristened child with nail trimmings, grain and cole-wort and chopping it all up very small and used it to take away the fruit of a man's corn.  Described night flight and flying on straw and a broom.  Said she used shot to send a soul to heaven but the body remained on earth.  She met the Queen of Fairy in the downie-hill and was given meat.  In the fairy hill she saw elf-bulls.  Took away milk using a tether (could restore milk by cutting the tether).  Did all this in the Devil's name.  She made an image of the Laird of Park to destroy his children (with others).  Detailed description of how the image was made.  Nearly the same description given by Janet Braidheid of the wax image!  She confessed to shape-changing with others- she was a kea (jackdaw) and the others were a cat and a hare.  They tied a thread with three knots and did something widdershins.  They raised the wind with a wet cloth and a beetle and specific words.  Their spirits can raise the wind.  She linked the elves and the Devil by saying that the Devil gave elves instructions on how to use and make elfshot and that they fire the shot in the Devil's name.  Special ritual described for shape-changing.  Had different words for each animal (cat, hare, crow, horse.  She lists different verbal charms to use for healing various ailments (bone-shaw, fevers).  For her first 'voyage' she went to the plough lands and shot a man and they made a potion by boiling ingredients and saying words they learned from the Devil.","She took away cow's milk by using a tether.  She also took away ale.  Words used o cure boneshaw and fevers,","Raised the wind with a wet cloth wet and a beetle in water.", , ,

Barroun denied the accusations.","Seen at the Nether Mylne Burn on Ruidday. Gathered stones some of which she threw in front of her and others over her shoulder. The she took three sips of water from a dish and spat them back into the burn.

"Unusual case to characterise. Fairies included as she mentioned spirits although she denied they were fairies. This is also a late case so quite unusual. The presbytery seem to have been most concerned with her blasphemy, which for a time they felt were delusions. However, after she escaped from prison the charges against her refer to devilrie, blasphemy and other particulars of witchcraft.","Brown confessed that the spirits came to her at any time and conversed with her.They were not visible, but she could feel them and they lay with her 'carnally as men and women do'. She told the presbytery the spirits were God because they could cure sickness, that they were her maker and were the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. She also said she was married to them and that the spirits would take her to Heaven. Later described how when she was younger 3 young, pretty men came to her mother's house and offered the family a piece of paper (?some form of contract) which she took and thereafter always knew more than other people.", ,"She confessed that they were good spirits, but did not refer to them as fairies, and they told her the world would be destroyed. Witnesses claimed she used charms, including a belt which had a tourner (a copper coin, not legal tender after 1707) and 3 pickles of wheat in it but she denied this. The spirits showed her a vision of the day of judgement, when the heavens were as thunder and fire.","Claimed that her spirits had caused the death of a man after Brown had quarrelled with his wife. Also confessed that she had cast water over a sick child and the child had recovered. Denied that she had quarrelled with a woman who hit her after shearing.", ,"Main accusation according to presbytery was blasphemy and devilish delusions which later became devilry, blasphemy and witchcraft.", ,
