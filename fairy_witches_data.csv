This document has lots of drawings and weird symbols, he could have been accused of learned magical practices.  He used letters and writings for healing.  A remedy for all women involved grinding almonds mixing them with egg whites and putting on their face.  For bleeding at the ???? -write letters on a knife and kill a beast.

On one occasion she used the thread and told the woman she was not bewitched nor did she have the fevers. The same woman complained that Lucas had made the walls of her house shake, and that Lucas had made the devil appear to her and her husband in the shape of four legged beasts.
