"The main accusations against her involved fall out from work, cloth, rent payment, debt, etc.  Her thirteen year old female servant was questioned about whether or not Margaret had kissed her.  She said yes, many times and she had kissed back.  Not sure exactly what was meant by this line of questioning?  The investigation and trial resulted from a backfire of Margaret's attempt to clear her name of witchcraft with slander litigation.  The kirk session hearing the case decided there was enough evidence to petition the privy council for a commission of justiciary.  She was also implicated, on 3 October 1628, by Elspeth Baird, burnt for witchcraft in Leith.",,,A woman diagnosed Margaret as the cause of a bewitchment.,These were in revenge for quarrels.,,,,"A funny note:  Margaret claimed that her lease had been eaten by a dog.  Her case seems to have resulted from a backfire from Margaret's pursuit of a slander case after she had been called a witch.

It is all about folk healing (charming).  He was being paid.  It was said that he could cure all but present death.  He made a direct challenge to the church saying he was more powerful than ministers because he could give people health (JC26/9 item 21). Maybe the mention of his familiar spirit was what shifted the case into witchcraft.  The demonic consisted of hearsay rumours that his mother had given him to the Devil.  The JC26/9 bundle has loads of information on specific words and cures used.,Had a 'familiar spreit'.  Hearsay evidence given in by a woman who said she heard Alexander say that his mother had given him over to the Devil (JC26/9 item 20).,,"Used a sick man's shirt for diagnosis of bewitchment.

Used south running water, powders to make drinks.  Told people not to eat meat on Fridays.  Said to use water where 'ane Christian King had ridden over' to wash a shirt for healing.  He kept a book of cures and had 3 special stones called 'slake stanes'.  Drummond called his healing words 'holy orations'.","He could cure frenaters, madness, the falling evil, destraction, apparitions, st. anthony's fire, noli me cangre, canceris wormes, glengores.

He was investigated by the minsters at Dunfermline on 31 May 1624.  The Presbytery of Auchterarder (Muthill) could not break him and he had a lot of support locally.  So the request was granted and he was transported to Edinburgh and tried there.  Three RPC entries discuss this.  There was a posthumous campaign to clear his name as 'ane notable Christian and did all his wondrous cures by lawfull meanes' (JC26/9 item 5).

"The commission does not give any information about accusations.  Her confessions in Pitcairn are too detailed to be able to put all the information in this case.  Anyone interested in her case should consult the printed documents!  This case could be the source for many of our modern ideas about witches (covens of 13, riding broomsticks, shape-changing, and lurid witches' meetings).  But is should be remembered that this case is not typical of most Scottish witchcraft cases.","She met the Devil in the Kirk of Auldearn. He was at the reader's desk with a black book in his hand.  He baptised her with blood he sucked out of her Devil's mark, spouted it in her hand and sprinkled it over her head.  His nature was cold.  She said that each witch had a spirit to wait on them.  One woman's was named 'swein' and was clothed in grass-green.  The text has detailed descriptions of people's spirits.  Her spirit was called 'The read reiver' and was dressed in black.  The Devil baptised her as 'Janet'.  The Devil's member was great and long.  She said that younger women had greater pleasure in sex with the Devil than with their own husbands.  The Devil beat them at meetings.  The Devil gave them money that turned into horse dung.","At Nairn she claimed that she and two others raised an unchristened child and used it to make a potion (see folk culture section for details).  She talked about covens and claimed to have 13 people in her coven.  Her coven danced on a hill with another coven.  At one meeting she yoked a plough of paddocks (toads).  They used this to take the fruit of the land.  The officer of her coven was man.  They often stole food from people.  She described taking grain and animals and leaving empty husks (later developed in fairylore).  Described flying on straw (corn straw, wild straw).  They did a ritual with a thread with three knots in a dye-house, they took away the dye and turned it all black.  She said that each coven of 13 had an officer (who is male) and a maiden (who is female).  The Devil took the maiden over the dyk.","She confessed to mixing the body of an unchristened child with nail trimmings, grain and cole-wort and chopping it all up very small and used it to take away the fruit of a man's corn.  Described night flight and flying on straw and a broom.  Said she used shot to send a soul to heaven but the body remained on earth.  She met the Queen of Fairy in the downie-hill and was given meat.  In the fairy hill she saw elf-bulls.  Took away milk using a tether (could restore milk by cutting the tether).  Did all this in the Devil's name.  She made an image of the Laird of Park to destroy his children (with others).  Detailed description of how the image was made.  Nearly the same description given by Janet Braidheid of the wax image!  She confessed to shape-changing with others- she was a kea (jackdaw) and the others were a cat and a hare.  They tied a thread with three knots and did something widdershins.  They raised the wind with a wet cloth and a beetle and specific words.  Their spirits can raise the wind.  She linked the elves and the Devil by saying that the Devil gave elves instructions on how to use and make elfshot and that they fire the shot in the Devil's name.  Special ritual described for shape-changing.  Had different words for each animal (cat, hare, crow, horse.  She lists different verbal charms to use for healing various ailments (bone-shaw, fevers).  For her first 'voyage' she went to the plough lands and shot a man and they made a potion by boiling ingredients and saying words they learned from the Devil.","She took away cow's milk by using a tether.  She also took away ale.  Words used o cure boneshaw and fevers,",Raised the wind with a wet cloth wet and a beetle in water.,,,

No details of accusations or confessions in the Presbytery accounts.  We have a large dossier of documents in JC26/13 bundle B.  Her case is one of the more detailed ones.  She was denounced by her mother.  Her threats and curses were accompanied by the gesture of blowing in the 'victims' face.,Was accused of killing babies and stealing them from her sister-in-law  for the Devil.  Her mother testified that she did this.  She did a ritual after childbirth to get the infants for the Devil (see folk culture for description),Another witch was described as 'ane of your devilishe soldiers' who Craig sent out to do harm.  The harmed man was troubled by wicked spirits that came riding out from under his bed.  Craig had divers associates in the coal pit.,She caused people to see many 'sichts' [sights] like ugly beasts and whelps.  She used a ritual to steal babies from her sister-in-law.  She rubbed her with three little enchanted stones after birth and she rubbed the child and the child died.  She did something with fox cure and south-running water.  She tried to enchant a man by causing his fire to take on the appearance of ugly cats with her likenss in the face.  And she cast lumps of raw flesh and blood around his floor.  She caused a man to have visions of wiched spirits riding out from under his bed.  It is unclear who scratched whom?,Caused someone to go mad and die; caused cows to give blood instead of milk. She caused her goodsister to loose her breast milk so Jeane could take her children. Caused a disease where blood flowed from a man's skin.,She blew in people's faces when uttering curses.,,,"A strange prosecution.  The high court of justiciary moved out to Tranent with the books of adjournal.  There is a seamless narration from the previous case to Craig on the same folio.  The prosecutor is not a normal one for witchcraft cases in the high court of justiciary.  They were sent out by the Committee of Estates (JC26/13, bundle B)."

"Most of the accusations resulted after a dispute about business type things, selling cows milk, the use of kailyards, fostering a child (foster care not wet-nursing), corn, coal and salt.  She was denounced by Elizabeth Stevin alias Toppok and Alexander Hammilton, but her neighbours were quick to provide evidence.",The information about her demonic pact comes from testimony by Alexander Hammilton another suspected witch at the time of her trial.  He is later convicted.  Sex with D on a hill in a den (valley) for 15min. with K. Gilmore (from A. Hammiltoun).,"Meeting at the suspect's house.  Very small gatherings.   Meetings at salt pans, again small gatherings but they raised a big storm at the 'Borrowing days' 29-31/3/1625.  The road was near a hole in a valley near Edmetstoun (Edmonston?).","Ritual involved plucking a nettle by the root, urinating on it and walking around it three times to cure a disease.  Her servant saw her light a fire between two doors and walk a new born calf over it.  A neighbour found her in a trance-like state laying on her floor by the fire, they heard a great din and mumbling.",These things happened after quarrels.,"Lots of damage to crops - kale, flax, hemp, corn.",,"Claimed that the only thing in her dittay that was an offence of any kind was the ritual with the nettle and the urine which the defence argued was a superstitious rite not witchcraft.  Lots of detailed legal pleadings, very rich on this.","Very complicated legal wrangling.  She was arrested in Nidrie, but because there was no tolbooth she was held in Edinburgh for 8 weeks with no movement in her case.  Husband complained, trial set for 22/9/1629, appointed sheriff and bailies of Edinbugh as judges - they needed help so PC appointed 4 assessors.  The trial didn't happen untill 11/11/1629."

"The whole case seems to be built around his confession of multiple meetings with the Devil and other witches.  Some healing with specific rituals, and revenge harm for refusal of charity but it mostly revolves around the Devil.  Need to know more about local context.","The Devil said he should not desire meat, clothing or money.  The Devil gave him a baton that he could use to raise the Devil - a magic wand?  He had to pay the Devil in kind with a cat, a laif, a dog or some other animal.  D gave him 4shillings, (Sterling).  The Devil also appeared to him in England.

At Coldingham Law he confessed to trying to destroy George Home of Manderston.","Using ulie (oil) spek cammomyle and heart creishc (creesh = fat, grease or tallow).  Lots of information about healing techniques in his dittay (JC26/9).  He supposedly tried to destroy Manderston by leaving a dead foul in his barn which killed lots of horses.

She walked withershins, southwards, and three times, involved in helping relieve the pain of childbirth.  She tried to cure her brother using South running water and by burning his things.  She was seen walking on Samuelstone's land and therefore being a part of Lady Samuelston's plot to kill her husband.  She was accused of doing a midwifery ritual that got her into trouble.  To ease the pain after childbirth she brought in a big pan of water, threw salt on a fire and rubbed the patient.  She then dipped her fingers in the water and sprinkled it over the patient three times while uttering words.  The words spoken were 'banes to the fyre and soule to the Devill'.

Complicated case involving numerous accusations of murdering children through magical strangulation and possession of several children.  Much of the evidence was derived from the testimony of children who claimed to be possessed and tormented by witches.  But there was great concern over the murdered children and a murdered minister.

Was also getting paid for healing.",,Janet Wischart and Helen Makkie confessed that Cockie had been with them at meetings on Hallowe'en at the fish and meal markets and the market cross in Aberdeen. Cockie does not appear to have confessed to anything and appears to have denied the charges.,"Accused of casting 'cantryps' between a victim's doors after which he took ill. Accused of having left a many coloured cloth at a neighbour's house. When she burnt it (fearing it was witchcraft) the fire cracked and they thought the house would fall. Said to one man 'I shall gar thee forthinkit that thow hev territ my howss, I being fra ham' - he then took ill. Met at twelve midnight. Gave a man a drink of herbs, butter and saifroun (saffron?), which he was to drink 3 times. Also wrapped a knotted green thread about his body and oxsters, then put it in the fire. Another thread was left round his waist and if it broke or not to put it in the fire. Told a woman to go to south running water to wash him. She was paid  20 shillings and half a firlot of meal for this.","Accused of causing a neighbour's milk to fail to churn. Accused of casting an illnes onto a neighbour after he and her husband fell out over the ownership of a house. Gave a man a drink with herbs, butter and saffron and a knotted green thread",Ruined milk products. Spoiled a mill. Caused a neighbour to be ruined and spoiled another's crops.,,,
She was part of a wife and husband team.  She definitely took the lead in their healing business.  She was paid quite a bit for healing.,,,Her documents specify what she was paid for healing.  Described her healing as 'melt the belt' for a sick child. This is likely to be mett or metting the belt - which involved measuring a child round the middle or from head to toe as a form of predicting the outcome of an illness.,She seems to have specialised in healing children.,,,,"She confessed to being a charmer but denied witchcraft.  Her records describe some of the same witchcraft incidents as her husband T. Paton, but from a different perspective.  Part of a group of 7 investigated by the presbytery of Dumfries on this date."
This characterisation may change as other family members are also tried later for witchcraft. It therefore seems like a neighbourhood dispute against an argumentative and unpopular family.,,,She cast cantrips or spells.,Numerous accusations of causing illness and deaths due to her casting cantrips. Accused of delaying the delivery of a child and of causing the child to be stillborn.,Accused of spoiling a whole brew (wort) of ale. Also accused of attempting to poison child who she had wanted to wetnurse.,,,
Witches meeting and tacit pact are probably not the primary characterisation although they feature. Family assocation appears very important and so neighbourhood dispute seems likely.,"Dittay mentions that Leyis's lover (Elspeth Reid) confessed that Leyis had asked her to meet a man, to take him by the ear and put her foot on the man's foot - all of which she refused to do.",,Leyis was accused of using cantrips to bewitch but no description of what they involved.

The child would be born on a Sunday after Martinmas.,Was witnessed to have cursed Mr Andrew Clark who he said would die if he took his mother to trial.,Accused of helping his mother bewitch goods and gear belonging to a neighbour.,,,
,Named as having attended meetings but no confession or description of pact.,Claimed that Thomas Leyis led them all in the dancing.,Mentioned of sunrise in confession.,"Accused of murdering her husband with a drink ?poison. Also gave another man 'slaik' at the request of his wife, he later died. Offered to help get rid of another woman's husband.",,,,
Barroun seems to have been quite argumentative and quarrelled and cursed her neighbours. Was also named by others (Christen Michell).,Barroun did not confess to the accusations and the dittay does not contain any description of demonic pact or relationship other than she was a witch by 'opin voce and common fame'.,Christen Michell claimed that Barroun and others danced at the fish and meal cross and James Thomson's yard. Barroun denied the accusations.,Seen at the Nether Mylne Burn on Ruidday. Gathered stones some of which she threw in front of her and others over her shoulder. The she took three sips of water from a dish and spat them back into the burn. The burn then stopped flowing to the mill and the mill stopped working.,"Cursed some women after disagreements, they later took ill and died. Cursed man who took ill but he did not die. Later his property was damaged and he lost £1000.","Was seen to have carried out a ritual at the Nether Mylne Burn, which caused the water flow to the mill to stop and the mill to stop working.",,,
It seems likely that this is a neighbourhood dispute involving the whole family. There are no details about the charges brought against Leyis apart from being 'airt and pairt' with Janet Wischert and Thomas Leyis.,,,,,,,,
"It is likely since the whole family was accused that this was some local neighbourhood dispute, however there is not enough details about the accusations against Jonet.",,,,,,,,
This may have been a local neighbourhood dispute as the whole family were accused but there are few details about the accusations against Violat.,,,,,,,,
May be part of family and neighbourhood dispute.,,,,,,,,
"Seems to be mostly neighbourhood dispute.  She is described as flyting, threatening and cursing 'fearfully'.  Person commenting in writing on the dittay said that the holy well incident was a charm not witchcraft.",,,She told the parents of a sick child to send it to St. Jroganis well.  The whole thing failed and the child died. This is St Jergan's well at Islesteps.,Failed healing attempt,Aqua Vitae is most probably whisky.  She caused a woman's aqua vitae barrels to dry up after being refused a sale.,,,Part of a group of seven investigated by the Presbytery of Dumfries on this date.

,The devil was called Christonday and taught Grant all her healing skills. There was also another devil called 'Our Ladye'.,Grant confessed to worshipping Christonday on her knees and receiving his token in her left hand. Not clear if this was something different from the Devil's mark.,Could charm a sword so that the owner would be protected from harm or injury. Healed using south running water and prayers.

"Unusual case to characterise. Fairies included as she mentioned spirits although she denied they were fairies. This is also a late case so quite unusual.

She also said she was married to them and that the spirits would take her to Heaven.

Jannett was seen lying within the sea mark with her mouth up, sucking the air 'lyk ane adder'.",,,"Her execution was described in a letter of Colonel Robert Sawrey, dated 26 April 1658.  He described her speech in which she denied all witchcraft and confessed to her wicked life and made exhortations to the living.  The speech is used in the letter to show that Ayr is hunting witches.  We already knew this from the many trial records we have."
"looks like a neighbourhood dispute one, but we don't have the dittay, just the witnesses responses to the dittay.  That does not give us enough information to tell for sure.",,,,accused of getting magical revenge for harm done to her family.,,,,
No specific details about Miller but according to Dumfries presbytery records it appears she was noted as a 'witch woman' but seems to have given advice about folk healing.  Her draft dittay shows that she was a recognised healer who travelled far and wide.  Her witchcraft reputation seems to have come from failed healing attempts and because she told people to keep her cures from the ministers.  Lots of fairry stuff.  The church and others might have been threatened by her advice to her patients to keep her cures a secret.  This may have lead people to believe that what she was doing was wrong?,"Says she convenit [convened] with the Devil in her dream.  She confessed to having a familiar, but it was not described as an an animal and it could have been a familiar spirit?  She claimed that the Devil gave her power to heal.  After her husband, [died?] she worried about her livelihood that is when the Devil came to her.  The Devil allowed her to hear the threatenings of other witches and see the diseases at great distance.",,"Foxtree leaves (foxglove) used to cure sickness. The consulter was told to take her mother to a certain place, wash her and use foxtree leaves, and leave the sickness at the place where she got it.  She diagnosed an illness as possibly related to the fairries having taken his tongue, if this was true she could be no help to him.  But he should try foxtree leaves and S. running water.  She gripped a child and told them to keep it close and away from the minister.  Diagnosed a child with 'Ferrie blast'.  She did a cure where the victim had to sit between three fires.  A ritual with smoke and fire to get a man out of a witch's grip.  Again told to keep it close especially from the minister.  Advised to keep the bible near for a cure for distempter.  She said a man became ill after digging up a thorn tree.  She diagnosed bewitchings as caused by Kirkcudbright and Dumfries witches (told the victims to get 3 stopings of straw from the witches' roof and burn them).","She denied doing any malefice, but said she could 'take off' diseases (i.e. cure). Healing ritual recorded in Dumfries presbytery records. She advised taking sick person to the place they got illness and carry out ritual in order to cure them.",,,,
"Looks like a neighbourhood dispute.  She also complained to the minister of slander and when he didn't take her seriously she cursed him and he got ill.  But for some reason, and despite lots of witness depositions, she was found not guilty.  Perhaps it is because those same witness did not offer compelling testimony during the trial?","She denied both of them, but they were mentioned in the trial record so I decided to list them here.",,Marione stole coal from a woman's hearth fire.  This seems to have been related to a bewitchment.  'A wife' told the women from whom Marion stole coal that this was not good and it resulted in a flyting incident between the two.  At an earlier point I think it was unclear which flyter was the 'witch'.  After the flyting the other woman woke up with a paddock [a toad] under her clothes and then her best cow died.,lots of cursing and fallouts followed by malefice.  She quarreled about corn. Other people's cattle eat her corn and she sent her animals to eat theirs.  Flyting.  Quarrels and curses over a borrowed horse.,She stole coal from a someone's hearth fire.,,,Listed as a Dumfries delinquent to be cited to appear in the tolbooth for 2/4/1659.  Was she going to be tried again?
definitely seems to be neighbourhood dispute and she seems to have been in trouble before for sleeping with an English soldier and she was fined 2 dollars by the bailies of Ayr for something.,mention of the Devil but nothing specific,,,was angry after being refused malt. Quarrels about daily tasks and after having been caught sleeping with an English soldier. Hatred of bailie of Ayr for fining her 2 dollars. Man refused to carry her malt.,,,,
"The circuit court record is just witness commentary on their deposition.  No clear indication of what the dittay said or what she was charged with.  Witness depositions mentioned some healingn activities, but this was more in the range of people asking her to remove illness that they believed she had caused (i.e. asking for removal of bewitchment).  She does not appear to have been a charmer.  The main problem seems to have been quarrelling, cursing and illness - i.e. neighbourhood dispute.","A description of a dog and hare of the accused going out to some cow.  The handwriting is difficult, hard to tell exactly what was happening, but could be a case of familiars.  The witness depositions allege a hare that was in her house and followed people after quarrels.",,"After she gave birth she caused the midwife to use supersticious rites, used salt for the baptism, instructed eveyone to walk home speechless from the baptism, and burn hindberry leaves around the child.","She also prayed for healing, but it seemed to fail quite a lot.  She was denied peats after a healing attempt failed. Her dittay is all about quarrels and threats, specifically about her lambs stealing grain and milk, and cow trouble.  Malicious prayers",,,,

The record in the circuit court documents is just comments from witnesses about their depositions and the dittay.  Not very clear.  Witness depositions have both healing and dispute elements.  I decided on dispute because there seems to be more description of malefice rather than curing.,,,She put a bannock in the wall to protect the cows.  Cured with a prayer and I think a fish?,"argument re: wages for a wright, curses, her beasts ate a man's seed stock so he kept her from the brewing water well (it filled with toads), injured the bailie after he poined her goods.",,,,We think this is the same person as C/EGD/2334.

Although she was called a 'pyker and a theif' I think this was slander, not an accurate description of her status.

From what we have in the witness depositions she confessed to demonic elements then retracted.

She said the Devil came to her in prison and said he could strangle her like he did for Helen Harris.  She claimed that no one else could see the devil in the tolbooth because he had rubbed something in her eyes.,Says she hosted witches within the walls of ??? Dundrenan.,She confessed to being away with the Fferrie.  Had a great meeting with the not earthen folkis and not earthly talkis.  They had a fire and dancing and myrth.  When asked how she knew them she said they were 'fairer and beltin busked [beltane bound] and that they spak with ane eldridge voyce' [elvish voice].

She claimed that no one else could see the devil in the tolbooth because he had rubbed something in her eyes.,,,,,
"The circuit court docs have bad handwriting and is just ratification of witness statements.  Found a second record of witness statements that shows that the main things here were disputes, curses and failed healing attempts.  One oblique mention of not being paid for healing.

The presbytery of Biggar were sceptical about her testimony and brought her to confront those she had named. They found many inconsistencies in her account and after prayer she confessed that she had only accused innocent people because Cathie had promised to prolong her life if she did so. The 48 individuals were therefore not pursued any further.  The case against them was dropped by the presbytery on 29/12/1649.

,,,,,,,,On 12/6/1650 the presbytery minutes recorded that 4 people in Castleton (in the presbytery of Langholm) were suspected of witchcraft and incantation. No names were recorded in the presbytery minutes.  Then on 26/6/1650 ministers were supposed to assist in the execution of the suspects.
Seems to have got into trouble because she advised people to use healing rituals.,,,Entries record that she advised the use of the blood and feathers of a black hen as a healing charm. Note: black cocks were used to cure the falling sickness but there is no mention of the illness or symptoms she was treating.,No details about the symptoms of illness which she could cure.,,,,
Although the Devil was not mentioned specifically it seems that the descriptions of fairies indicated demonic involvement. The king of fairies seemed to = the Devil.,Mentioned that man in black clothes made her go forward and was at meetings with them all. She also referred to one man being the king of fairies who lay with her. She was asked if his nature was hot or cold to which she replied that it was cold. Told minister that she renounced her baptism to the king of fairies.,A number of cats came to her house which turned into men and women. Also went with a group of male and female fairies and one man had sex with her and another woman.,Used water from St Mungo's well to heal her father and spoke verse/charm.,Confessed she and others had caused death of Mr James Ross and one of his children. This may have been the James Ross who was minister at Livingston and who died in 1641.,,,,
Demonic as primary as it seems those involved may have read fairies as meaning the Devil or devils. The Devil was only mentioned once compared to several mentions of fairies.,She confessed that she put her own hand on the crown of her head and the other upon the sole of her foot and declared all betwixt the two over to a black man with black clothes and that the devil appeared to her.,,Used term 'good neighbours' who wore green kirtalls. The fairies wanted a nurse for one of their own offspring. BP told them to go to a neighbour's house but the woman would not go with them and so her child was killed. This may indicate a changeling type motif but it is not mentioned specifically.,One of the company whirled them all in the wind. Woman in green put sickness on one of her neighbours. She put whirl wind in the house of one of her neighbours and caused the woman to 'rattell till death'.,,,,
,,,,,,,,"'a great many persons' from Musselburgh, Dalkeith, Newbattle, Newton (+ Woomet) and Duddingston but no number or names specified, number calculated as three from each place.

He was suspected then became a star witness.  Not prosecuted.  Complicated case involving numerous accusations of murdering children through magical strangulation and possession of several children.  Much of the evidence was derived from the testimony of children who claimed to be possessed and tormented by witches.  But there was great concern over the murdered children and a murdered minister.  The record describes the physical torment of the possessed children in great detail.  An extraordinary document!,,,,,,,,Accused but not indicted for witchcraft.  Instead he and his brother were witnesses.  Deemed too young to have made a viable pact with the Devil.

He was mentioned on the last day of that trial (19/5/1697) in the closing arguments.
